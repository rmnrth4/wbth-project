##Usage

In order to run the code locally, we recommend to use conda to create an environment with all the necessary dependencies. If you don't have conda installed we recommend to install miniforge which is a minimal conda installer. Once installed, you can create the environment by moving to the repository folder and running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To use the environment, you can activate it with the following command:

```bash
conda activate WBTH-Project
```
